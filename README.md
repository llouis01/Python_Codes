### Learning Python ###

Utilizing Python to analyze data is a top priority for Analysts. My goal is to achieve that readiness through 
constant practicing. Most of the codes in this repository are for practicing purposes and may contain non-factual 
datasets creatively generated by me. If the dataset is from an actual database or website,
I will comment it in the begining of the program.

### New Guidelines ###

Starting from today, I will provide instructions about programs I create in this repository in this document.

### Dict.py ###

Manipulating a dictionary in python. Worked on adding keys, updating values, deleting keys and 
using chained commands to pull info from a dictionary of dictionary.

### Pds.py ### 

Working with Pandas to manipulate data.
1) import dataset or create one; transform it into a dataframe using pandas.DataFrame(dataset)
2) transforming datasets into appropriate dataframe
3) specifying which column is used for row labels with index_col parameter

### Op.py ###

In this script, I am experimenting with boolean operators on dataframes.

### Nyc_cvd.py ###

Pulled down dataset with daily counts of Covid-19 stats. Calculated the average and rearranged 
dataset broken monthly. Then I used Matplotlip and Pandas to draw a graph of the monthly 
average death counts.
